# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm JosuÃ©

## About Me
Iâ€™m a Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for transforming raw data into clear, compelling insights. With a strong foundation in data wrangling, visualisation, and interpretation, I help organisations make smarter, data-informed decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Expertise â€“ Data Analysis
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Skilled in transforming messy datasets into analysis-ready formats using Python (pandas, NumPy) and SQL  
- **Insight Generation**: Drawing out trends, patterns, and actionable insights through data storytelling and visual techniques  
- **Data Visualisation**: Creating clear and interactive visualisations with Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- **SQL & Relational Databases**: Writing complex queries for extraction, transformation, and analysis in PostgreSQL  
- **Business Intelligence**: Experienced in delivering dashboards and performance metrics for stakeholder reporting  
- **Certifications**: DataCamp-certified in Data Analysis with Python and SQL  
- **Learning Pathways**: Completed tracks in Python, SQL, and Tableau on DataCamp

## ðŸ§  Expanding Expertise â€“ Data Science Skills
- **Machine Learning**: Building models for classification, regression, and clustering with scikit-learn  
- **Statistical Thinking**: Applying hypothesis testing, A/B testing, and statistical inference to real-world problems  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful variables to improve model outcomes and explainability  
- **Model Evaluation**: Understanding and applying metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- **Data Preparation for Modelling**: Effective pipeline creation and use of techniques such as encoding, scaling, and imputation  
- **Experiment Design**: Designing experiments and analysing outcomes to drive decision-making

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus
I'm actively building my data portfolio here on GitHub with projects that reflect both analytical rigour and visual storytelling. My current areas of focus include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Interactive dashboards in Tableau  
- Experimentation and predictive modelling  
- Machine learning applications using Python and scikit-learn

## ðŸ’¡ Open to Collaboration
Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on data-driven projects, particularly in the areas of data analysis, visualisation, and model development. Letâ€™s create insights that matter.
